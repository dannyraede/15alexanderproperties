# Building Pattern Recognition App Specification

## 1. Overview
An application that uses AI to analyze photographs of buildings and identify the presence of Christopher Alexander's 15 fundamental patterns.

## 2. Key Features
- Live camera feed
- Photo capture
- Image analysis for 15 fundamental patterns
- Results display

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend
- Web-based application using HTML5, vanilla JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Utilizes HTML5 Canvas API for camera feed and photo capture

### 3.2 Backend
- Node.js-based API hosted on Vercel
- Serverless functions for image processing and analysis

### 3.3 AI/ML Components
- Image recognition model
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for pattern description

### 3.4 Storage
- Vercel's integrated storage solutions for temporary image storage

## 4. User Flow
1. User opens the app and grants camera permissions
2. Live camera feed is displayed on the screen
3. User captures a photo of a building
4. Photo is uploaded to Vercel's storage
5. Backend initiates a series of AI/ML processes
6. Results are returned and displayed to the user

## 5. AI Processing Pipeline
1. Image preprocessing
2. Feature extraction
3. Pattern recognition for each of the 15 fundamental patterns
4. Generation of explanations for identified patterns

## 6. Output Format
JSON object containing:
- Boolean values for each of the 15 properties
- Text descriptions explaining the presence of each identified property

## 7. Performance Requirements
- Photo capture and upload: < 3 seconds
- AI analysis and results return: < 10 seconds

## 8. Security Considerations
- Secure handling of camera permissions
- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Temporary storage and deletion of uploaded images

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Offline mode with on-device AI processing
- Comparison tool for multiple buildings
- Integration with AR for real-time pattern identification

## 10. Development Phases
1. MVP: Basic camera functionality and single pattern recognition
2. Full pattern recognition implementation
3. UI/UX improvements and result visualization
4. Performance optimization and security enhancements
