export const LEVELSOFSCALE_DEFINITION = `Levels of Scale, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of a hierarchical range of sizes in a design or structure, from the very large to the very small, with a balanced and meaningful distribution of sizes in between. This property is fundamental to living structures and suggests that well-designed environments exhibit a fractal-like quality, where similar patterns and forms repeat at different scales.

Levels of Scale have several key characteristics:
1. They create a hierarchical range of sizes within a structure or design.
2. They exhibit a balanced and meaningful distribution of sizes.
3. They often show fractal-like qualities, with similar patterns repeating at different scales.
4. Each scale level has a purpose and contributes to the overall functionality and beauty.
5. They create a sense of visual coherence and allow for smooth transitions between scales.
6. They typically include multiple discernible scale levels, from the largest overall forms to the smallest details.
7. They support human comfort and engagement at various levels of interaction.

Alexander emphasizes that these levels of scale should follow a specific progression. This creates a sense of visual coherence and allows for a smooth transition between different scales. The property also implies that each scale level should have a purpose and contribute to the overall functionality and beauty of the structure. Furthermore, Alexander notes that the most satisfying and life-enhancing environments typically contain multiple discernible scale levels, ranging from the largest (such as the overall form of a building or landscape) to the smallest (such as surface textures or decorative details). This multi-scalar approach creates a rich, complex environment that feels both unified and diverse, supporting human comfort and engagement at various levels of interaction.`
