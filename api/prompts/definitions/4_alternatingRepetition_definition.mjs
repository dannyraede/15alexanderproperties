export const ALTERNATINGREPETITION_DEFINITION = `Alternating Repetition, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of recurring elements or patterns in a design or structure, but with variations or alternations that create rhythm and interest. This property suggests that well-designed structures have repetitive elements that are not monotonous, but rather alternate in some way to create a dynamic and engaging composition.

Alternating Repetition has several key characteristics:
1. It involves the recurrence of similar elements or patterns within a structure or design.
2. The repetition is not exact, but includes variations or alternations.
3. It creates a sense of rhythm and visual interest through the interplay of similarity and difference.
4. It helps to unify the overall composition while avoiding monotony.
5. The alternations can occur in various aspects such as size, color, orientation, or arrangement.
6. It often creates a sense of movement or progression within the design.
7. It supports both unity and diversity within the same structure.

Alexander emphasizes that alternating repetition is crucial for creating designs that are both coherent and engaging. This property allows for a balance between predictability and surprise, which keeps the viewer's interest while maintaining a sense of order. The alternations in the repetition can create a hierarchy or emphasize certain elements, guiding the viewer's attention through the composition. Furthermore, alternating repetition can often reflect natural patterns found in living systems, contributing to the sense of life and organic quality in a design. This property can be observed at various scales, from the overall structure down to the smallest details, contributing to the richness and complexity of the design.`
