export const ECHOES_DEFINITION = `Echoes, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the repetition of similar shapes, patterns, or elements throughout a design or structure, creating a sense of unity and coherence. This property suggests that well-designed structures have recurring themes or forms that resonate across different scales and areas of the composition, contributing to a harmonious and interconnected whole.

Echoes have several key characteristics:
1. They involve the repetition of similar forms, patterns, or motifs within a structure or design.
2. They create a sense of unity and coherence across different parts of the composition.
3. They can occur at various scales, from large structural elements to small decorative details.
4. They contribute to the overall rhythm and harmony of the design.
5. They often create visual or thematic connections between different areas or components.
6. They can reinforce the identity or character of a space or structure.
7. They support the creation of a holistic and integrated design experience.

Alexander emphasizes that echoes are crucial for creating designs that feel cohesive and alive. This property allows for the establishment of visual and conceptual relationships between different parts of a structure, enhancing its overall unity and aesthetic appeal. Echoes can guide the viewer's perception through a composition, creating a sense of familiarity and continuity. Furthermore, the repetition of elements can reinforce the identity or character of a space, making it more memorable and distinctive. Effective use of echoes can also contribute to the emotional impact of a design, creating a sense of rhythm, balance, or progression. It's important to note that echoes don't necessarily mean exact repetition; they can involve variations or transformations of a theme, allowing for both unity and diversity within the same structure.`
