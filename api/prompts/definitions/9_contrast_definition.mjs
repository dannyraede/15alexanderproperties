export const CONTRAST_DEFINITION = `Contrast, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of distinct differences or oppositions in elements within a design or structure. This property suggests that well-designed structures incorporate contrasting elements that create visual interest, emphasize important features, and contribute to the overall balance and harmony of the composition. Contrast is essential for creating dynamic, engaging environments that capture attention and provide visual clarity.

Contrast has several key characteristics:
1. It involves the juxtaposition of opposing elements or qualities within a design.
2. It creates visual interest and helps to draw attention to specific areas or features.
3. It can occur in various aspects such as color, shape, size, texture, or direction.
4. It contributes to the overall balance and harmony of a composition.
5. It helps to create hierarchy and emphasize important elements within a structure.
6. It can evoke emotional responses and influence the perception of space and form.
7. It supports the clarity and legibility of a design, making it easier to understand and navigate.

Alexander emphasizes that contrast is crucial for creating designs that are both visually appealing and functionally effective. This property allows for the creation of focal points, the definition of boundaries, and the establishment of visual hierarchies within a structure. Contrast can guide the viewer's eye through a composition, highlighting key elements and creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. Furthermore, the interplay between contrasting elements can create a sense of tension or harmony, depending on how they are balanced and integrated within the overall design. Effective use of contrast can enhance the emotional impact of a space, making it feel more dynamic, exciting, or calming. It also plays a vital role in improving the accessibility and usability of a design by clearly differentiating between different elements and spaces.`
