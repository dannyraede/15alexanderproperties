export const BOUNDARIES_DEFINITION = `Boundaries, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the edges, borders, or transitions that define and separate different areas or elements within a design or structure. These boundaries can be physical or implied, and they play a crucial role in organizing space, creating coherence, and enhancing the strength of centers. This property is essential to living structures and suggests that well-designed environments have clear, yet permeable demarcations that contribute to the overall harmony and functionality of the space.

Boundaries have several key characteristics:
1. They define and separate different areas or elements within a structure or design.
2. They can be physical (like walls or fences) or implied (like changes in texture or color).
3. They contribute to the organization and clarity of a composition.
4. They often enhance the strength of centers by providing definition and contrast.
5. They create a sense of enclosure and protection while allowing for connectivity.
6. They can exist at various scales, from large architectural elements to small decorative details.
7. They often exhibit a balance between separation and connection, allowing for appropriate levels of interaction between different areas.

Alexander emphasizes that effective boundaries are not just barriers, but active zones of transition and interaction. They should be clear enough to provide definition and structure, yet permeable enough to allow for necessary connections and flow between different areas. Well-designed boundaries contribute to the overall coherence of a space while also supporting the distinct identity of individual elements or regions. Furthermore, boundaries play a crucial role in creating a sense of place and belonging, helping to define both public and private spaces within a larger context. The most successful boundaries, according to Alexander, are those that enhance the life and functionality of the spaces they define, rather than simply dividing them.`
