export const GRADIENTS_DEFINITION = `Gradients, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the smooth and gradual transitions between different elements, qualities, or states within a design or structure. This property suggests that well-designed structures incorporate subtle changes in color, texture, size, or other attributes that create a sense of flow and continuity, enhancing the overall harmony and coherence of the composition.

Gradients have several key characteristics:
1. They create smooth transitions between different elements or qualities within a structure or design.
2. They can occur in various aspects such as color, texture, size, shape, or density.
3. They contribute to a sense of flow and continuity in the overall composition.
4. They often create a sense of depth, movement, or progression within the design.
5. They help to unify different parts of a structure by providing subtle connections.
6. They can guide the viewer's attention and create focal points within the composition.
7. They support both unity and diversity within the same structure by allowing for variation without abrupt changes.

Alexander emphasizes that gradients are essential for creating designs that feel natural and alive. This property allows for a seamless integration of different elements, avoiding harsh contrasts that might disrupt the overall harmony. Gradients can create a sense of depth and dimensionality, enhancing the visual richness of a design. They can also be used to guide the viewer's eye through a composition, creating a natural flow and hierarchy. Furthermore, gradients often reflect patterns found in nature, contributing to the organic quality of a design. This property can be observed at various scales, from the overall structure down to the finest details, adding to the complexity and interest of the design while maintaining a sense of unity.`
