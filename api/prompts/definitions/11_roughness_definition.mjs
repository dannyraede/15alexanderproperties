export const ROUGHNESS_DEFINITION = `Roughness, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of irregularities, imperfections, or textural variations in a design or structure. This property suggests that well-designed structures incorporate a degree of roughness that adds character, visual interest, and a sense of natural authenticity to the overall composition. Roughness is essential for creating environments that feel alive, organic, and harmonious with nature.

Roughness has several key characteristics:
1. It involves the presence of non-uniform or irregular elements within a structure or design.
2. It adds visual and tactile interest through variations in texture, form, or finish.
3. It contributes to a sense of natural authenticity and organic quality.
4. It can occur at various scales, from overall form to fine details.
5. It often reflects the process of creation or the passage of time.
6. It creates a balance between order and disorder within the composition.
7. It enhances the human connection to the environment by evoking natural patterns and processes.

Alexander emphasizes that roughness is crucial for creating designs that feel genuine and alive. This property allows for a balance between precision and imperfection, which often results in more engaging and relatable environments. Roughness can create a sense of depth and dimensionality, enhancing the visual richness of a design. It can also contribute to the functionality of a structure by providing grip, reducing glare, or creating microclimates. Furthermore, roughness often reflects the handmade or natural qualities of materials, contributing to a sense of craftsmanship and connection to the creation process. This property can be observed at various scales, from the overall structure down to the finest details, adding to the complexity and interest of the design while maintaining a sense of organic unity.`
