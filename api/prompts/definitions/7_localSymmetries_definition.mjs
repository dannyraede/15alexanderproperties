export const LOCALSYMMETRIES_DEFINITION = `Local Symmetries, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of balanced, symmetrical arrangements within smaller parts or regions of a larger structure, even if the overall composition is not strictly symmetrical. This property suggests that well-designed structures have pockets of symmetry at various scales, contributing to a sense of order and harmony within the complexity of the whole.

Local Symmetries have several key characteristics:
1. They occur at multiple scales within a structure or design, from larger elements to smaller details.
2. They create a sense of balance and order within specific areas or components.
3. They contribute to the overall coherence of the design without requiring strict global symmetry.
4. They often appear in natural forms and living structures.
5. They can enhance the aesthetic appeal and visual interest of a composition.
6. They may support structural stability or functional efficiency in certain contexts.
7. They interact with other properties, such as Levels of Scale and Alternating Repetition, to create rich, complex designs.

Alexander emphasizes that local symmetries are crucial for creating designs that feel harmonious and alive. Unlike rigid, overall symmetry, local symmetries allow for a balance between order and variety, creating compositions that are both structured and organic. These symmetries can occur at various scales, from the arrangement of major elements down to the details of ornamentation or texture. The presence of local symmetries often contributes to a sense of wholeness and coherence, even in designs that appear complex or diverse at first glance. Furthermore, local symmetries can enhance the functionality and stability of structures, as symmetrical forms often distribute forces evenly. This property reflects patterns found in nature and living systems, where perfect symmetry is rare, but local, nested symmetries are common. By incorporating local symmetries, designers can create environments that feel both ordered and natural, supporting human comfort and aesthetic appreciation.
Expected output: Provide a detailed analysis of the image in two paragraphs, explaining how it demonstrates the property of Local Symmetries. In the first paragraph, identify and describe the various local symmetries present in the image, from larger symmetrical arrangements to smaller, more subtle ones. Discuss how these symmetries relate to each other and contribute to the overall composition.`
