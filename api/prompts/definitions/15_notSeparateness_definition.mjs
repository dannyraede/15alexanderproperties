export const NOTSEPARATENESS_DEFINITION = `Not Separateness, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the quality of a design or structure that is well-integrated with its surroundings, creating a sense of unity and belonging. This property suggests that well-designed structures have a seamless connection to their environment, blurring the boundaries between the object and its context. Not Separateness emphasizes the importance of creating harmonious relationships between different elements of a design and its surrounding environment.

Not Separateness has several key characteristics:
1. It creates a sense of unity between the structure and its surroundings.
2. It blurs the boundaries between different elements, creating smooth transitions.
3. It promotes a feeling of belonging and contextual appropriateness.
4. It enhances the overall coherence of the environment.
5. It often involves the use of materials, forms, or colors that complement the surroundings.
6. It creates spaces that feel connected and integrated rather than isolated or disconnected.
7. It supports the overall harmony and balance of the larger environment.

Alexander emphasizes that Not Separateness is crucial for creating environments that feel whole and alive. This property ensures that a design, while potentially distinct in its function or form, presents itself as an integral part of its context. It involves careful consideration of how a structure relates to its surroundings, both visually and functionally. The integration achieved is not about mimicry or camouflage, but rather about creating meaningful connections that enhance both the structure and its environment. This quality can improve the usability and emotional resonance of a space by making it feel more natural and contextually appropriate. Furthermore, designs that embody Not Separateness often contribute positively to their broader environment, enhancing rather than disrupting the existing fabric of a place.`
