export const STRONGCENTERS_DEFINITION = `Strong Centers, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of well-defined focal points or areas of emphasis within a design or structure. These centers are distinct, coherent elements that attract attention and organize the space around them, contributing to the overall unity and life of the composition. Alexander emphasizes that strong centers are not merely visual focal points, but are fundamental organizing principles that give life and energy to a structure.

Strong centers have several key characteristics:
1. They are areas of intense activity or concentration within the larger whole.
2. They have a clear boundary or definition that separates them from their surroundings.
3. They exhibit internal coherence and often have a sense of wholeness within themselves.
4. They interact with and support other centers in the composition, creating a hierarchical network.
5. They contribute to the overall structure's feeling of life and vitality.
6. They can exist at various scales, from the very large to the very small.
7. They often have a quality of "recursion," where smaller centers support and enhance larger ones.

Alexander argues that the presence of strong centers is essential for creating spaces and structures that feel alive, harmonious, and deeply satisfying to human perception and experience.`
