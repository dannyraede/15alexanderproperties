export const GOODSHAPE_DEFINITION = `Good Shape, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the presence of well-defined, coherent forms in a design or structure. This property suggests that well-designed structures have elements with clear, purposeful shapes that contribute to the overall harmony and functionality of the composition. Good Shape is essential for creating visually appealing and functionally effective environments.

Good Shape has several key characteristics:
1. It involves clearly defined forms with distinct boundaries.
2. The shapes are coherent and have a sense of completeness in themselves.
3. Each shape has a purpose and contributes to the overall design.
4. The shapes are well-proportioned and balanced.
5. There is a harmonious relationship between different shapes within the composition.
6. The shapes are often simple and easily recognizable.
7. Good shapes can exist at various scales within the design.

Alexander emphasizes that good shape is crucial for creating structures that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective. This property ensures that each element in a design is intentional and contributes positively to the whole. Good shapes are often simple and easily recognizable, which allows for quick comprehension and a sense of order within the design. The interplay between different good shapes can create a sense of rhythm and balance, enhancing the overall composition. Furthermore, good shapes often have a timeless quality, resonating with fundamental patterns found in nature and human perception. This property applies at various scales, from the overall form of a building to the shape of individual components, contributing to a coherent and satisfying design at all levels.`
