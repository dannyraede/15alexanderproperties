export const POSITIVESPACE_DEFINITION = `Positive Space, as described by Christopher Alexander, refers to the way in which space is shaped and utilized in a design or structure. It emphasizes the idea that every space, whether it's the foreground or background, should have a clear, well-defined shape that contributes positively to the overall composition. This property suggests that well-designed structures have no leftover or neglected spaces, but rather every area serves a purpose and enhances the whole.

Positive Space has several key characteristics:
1. Every space, including background areas, has a distinct and intentional shape.
2. There are no "leftover" or neglected spaces; all areas contribute to the composition.
3. The shapes of spaces are well-defined and have a positive quality.
4. Spaces interact harmoniously with each other, creating a balanced composition.
5. Both figure and ground (or object and surrounding space) are equally important.
6. The relationship between spaces creates a sense of wholeness and coherence.
7. Spaces at different scales work together to support the overall structure.

Alexander emphasizes that positive space is crucial for creating environments that feel alive and harmonious. This property ensures that every part of a design is purposeful and contributes to the overall experience. In well-designed structures, the spaces between objects are as carefully considered as the objects themselves, leading to a sense of completeness and balance. Positive space also contributes to the functionality and usability of a design, as it ensures that all areas are accessible and serve a purpose. Furthermore, the interplay between positive spaces can create a sense of movement, rhythm, and visual interest, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal of the structure. This property applies at various scales, from the layout of a city down to the arrangement of elements in a single room or artwork, contributing to the holistic quality of the design.`
