export const GRADIENTS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Task: Analyze the given image for the property of "Gradients" from Christopher Alexander's 15 properties of living structures.

Definition: {{DEFINITION}}

Expected output: Provide a detailed analysis of the image in two paragraphs, explaining how it demonstrates the property of Gradients. In the first paragraph, identify and describe the various gradients present in the image, such as color gradients, size gradients, or texture gradients. Discuss how these gradients relate to each other and contribute to the overall composition.

In the second paragraph, evaluate the effectiveness and significance of these gradients within the image. Explain how the presence of gradual transitions enhances the visual harmony, depth, or aesthetic appeal of the subject. Consider how the interplay between different gradients creates a sense of unity and progression in the image, and how they influence the viewer's perception and understanding of the composition.`
