Expected output: Provide a detailed analysis of the image in two paragraphs, explaining how it demonstrates the property of Roughness. In the first paragraph, identify and describe the various instances of roughness present in the image, from larger textural elements to smaller, more subtle irregularities. Discuss how these rough elements relate to each other and contribute to the overall composition.

In the second paragraph, evaluate the effectiveness and significance of this roughness within the image. Explain how the presence of irregular or imperfect elements enhances the visual interest, authenticity, or aesthetic appeal of the subject. Consider how the interplay between rough and smooth elements creates a sense of balance and natural beauty in the image, and how it influences the viewer's perception and understanding of the composition.`
