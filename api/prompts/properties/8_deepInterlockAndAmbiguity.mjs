export const DEEPINTERLOCKANDAMBIGUITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Task: Analyze the given image for the property of "Deep Interlock and Ambiguity" from Christopher Alexander's 15 properties of living structures.

Definition: {{DEFINITION}}

Expected output: Provide a detailed analysis of the image in two paragraphs, explaining how it demonstrates the property of Deep Interlock and Ambiguity. In the first paragraph, identify and describe the areas of interlock and ambiguity present in the image, discussing how different elements or spaces merge, overlap, or create unclear boundaries. Explain how these interlocking relationships contribute to the overall composition and create a sense of depth and complexity.

In the second paragraph, evaluate the effectiveness and significance of the deep interlock and ambiguity within the image. Discuss how the presence of these intricate relationships enhances the visual interest, spatial richness, or conceptual depth of the subject. Consider how the interplay between clearly defined and ambiguous elements creates a sense of mystery and engagement in the image, and how it influences the viewer's perception and interpretation of the composition.`
